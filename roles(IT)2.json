I learnt and understood the working behind GPT-3. It is a machine learning model which takes a sequence of inputs and generates the output by using what the model has learned during its training phase. It started with an untrained model, it was trained on a huge dataset consisting of million tokens of text. One step of the training of GPT 3 is to generate multiple training examples. When the model generates the output, it'll be not a good output, that's because it's being trained, then we tell the correct answer and then calculate the error and then the gradients are adjusted using back propagation, we tell how much the prediction is wrong and that error calculation is fed back into the model, so that when the next time the model gives us the output, there'll be less error and more accuracy. GPT 3 takes each token at a time and also, outputs one token at a time. The main thing about GPT-3 is its size, it is a huge model, has 175 billion parameters. The parameters are stored into various matrices, generating the prediction is multiplying the matrices together by the inputs. When we process a word, we process the vector and it goes through various layers of transformer decoders and GPT-3 has 96 of these transformer decoders. It is trained on 'next word' prediction the transformer decoder will train the parameters so that it can predict the next word using a bunch of words at the input.

Next steps were to decide a database and a model. Choosing the right dataset was a hard task and it took us quite a bit of time and experimenting to finally arrive at the right one. Our mentor told us try out two models which go by the name of YOLO and Faster-RCNN. We researched them and trained on the two models and found better results on YOLOv5.
