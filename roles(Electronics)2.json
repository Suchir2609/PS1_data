I wrote a node.js code that produced a log file containing information about all the processes running in a particular system. It collected data at regular intervals of 5 minutes from every system. We needed to use the data for training our machine learning model, so we wanted the data to be in CSV format. For that, I wrote a C++ code that took a log file as input and produced corresponding CSV file as output. After that I along with my project partner built a multi-class classification model for finding out the non-genuine processes and we tweaked it according to our dataset for producing better results.
