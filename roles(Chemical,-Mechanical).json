Also, the future improvement prospects are heavily dependent on fin efficiency and heat storage materials so as to optimize the heat transfer. the heating elements are the core of the air-preheater, and changes in plate geometry have a substantial impact on APH performance. The heat transfer characteristics of the plates can be determined using a wind tunnel-like setup that seeks to imitate the conditions of an air-preheater. However, there may be a significant discrepancy in the readings when we compare the simulated readings to the readings of the experiment performed on an actual air-preheater, indicating that additional work needs to be done to determine the performance characteristics of the heating components.

It employs two  Twin Lobe impellers mounted on parallel shafts, rotating in  opposite direction within a casing closed at the ends by side  plates. As the impellers rotate, air is drawn into one side of the  casing and forced out of the opposite side against the existing  pressures. The differential pressure developed, therefore,  depends upon the resistance of the connected system. The  Blowers, being positive displacement type, do not develop  pressure within the casing but the discharge pressure depends  upon the system resistance / back pressure. Effective sealing of  the compressor inlet area from the discharge area is accomplished  by use of very small operational clearance, eliminating the need of  any internal lubrication of the lobes. A pair of accurately machined  alloy steel, hardened and ground timing gears maintain clearances  between the impellers, during rotation. The air, thus delivered, is  100% OILFREE. The pumping capacity of a lobe compressor,  operating at constant speed remains relatively independent of  inlet and discharge pressure variations. These Blowers are  constant volume machines, which deliver a fixed discharge against  the system back pressure. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that  minimum pipeline restrictions, at the inlet and discharge, are  imposed. Adequate size piping and large radius bends ensure  minimum line losses resulting in higher efficiency and low power  consumption. Sudden change in pipeline cross section should also  be avoided. ",

We chose 5 variables, for this purpose, out of the various variables present in the dataset after carrying out ANOVA test for each variable and calculating the P-Values. We applied Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Support Vector Machine Regression on these 5 variables to build the ML model using various Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn.  We also generated the graph for Decision Tree Regression. We also performed various types of error analysis on the results obtained through the 3 different regressions. These results can help us in optimising the design of boilers and thus, reducing the amount of unburnt carbon in fly ash. ",

        "title": " Enhancing Efficiency of Klaus-Klin Plant ",
        "summary": "I was assigned a project to enhance the efficiency of Klaus-Klin Plant which is a Sulphur Recovery Plant. I had to complete the project along with 4 other team members. In the project, I had to increase the recovery efficiency of Sulphur extracted from Hydrogen Sulphide combined in Inlet Feed Gases. I started by understanding the reactions and components of the plant followed by exact compositions of elements, temperature, pressure and many more requirements by a meet with the industry mentor. I had then consulted and read many research papers and articles for understanding the recovery efficiency, thermal efficiency, conversion efficiency, air demand of the plant. After doing sufficient research on the plant, I simulated a model of the plant using DWSim Software. The software helped me understand the change in recovery efficiencies caused by variations in temperature, pressure, molar flow rates, flow directions and compositions. Using the software, I made sufficient changes in the model by changing initial compositions, using conversion reactors, setting package and outlet temperatures through converters, condensers, changing flow directions, and adding extra components like  additional separators, converter, conversion separator, heater and compound separator. The cost-based simulator add-in in DWSim helped me analyze the extra cost of adding each part and the return it was gaining in terms of cost of Sulphur recovered. After trying out many test cases, I finally reached a case where I was getting the recovery efficiency higher than expected thus making the model successful. The entire model was made using Peng-Robison Package in DWSim. ",

I learnt complex and realistic mass and material  balances across specific parts of plant . Moreover, the industry expert session organized by PSD helped to understand core topics better. "

        "summary": "Viscose fiber is a manmade natural fiber, made from pulp obtained from wood or even cotton. Our work involved understanding step by step, the procedure followed to obtain viscose-steps such as steeping(dissolution), maturing (depolymerization), xanthation(reaction with CS2), followed by the filtration procedure. Filtration system has 3 main stages- with different filter media sizes of 20u,18u and 35u(reject stage), and cumulatively 5 stages and centrifugation, before the leftover is rejected. Reject is usually the undissolved/unreacted  cellulose, gels etc. Approximately 420MT of viscose is processed each day at the Nagda Plant, and around 3% of this total viscose processed is rejected. Our work was to find/design/identify steps which can reduce this number. Process of viscose is important as the same controls the amount of final product produced- required and unwanted. For example-with the use of 18% NaOH solution for mercerization, we can avoid the production of hemicellulose-for that we can implement an online NaOH concentration analyzer to keep track of its concentration. Methods such as hydrothermal treatment of pulp or use of surface active reagents have been highlighted as per literature review as they can reduce the unwanted gels and knots formed and thus improve the productivity. Each time piston moves inside the filtration drum, about 20L of viscose gets rejected. So the above mentioned parameters can help reduce the piston strokes. Using a spring flap on the piston helps prevent filtered viscose get rejected. ",

The function of separators in the cement industry is to separate fine particles from coarse particles to obtain good, quality cement. Due to excessive usage, the equipment tends to wear out and requires repair. Repairing the equipment after it shows symptoms of wear and tear is expensive and time-consuming, considering the duration it remains unusable during the repair. By predicting the repair requirement time of a separator before it breaks down, the industry saves extra expenses and time; this is the concept of Predictive maintenance in laypeople's terms. Predictive maintenance helps anticipate when specific equipment might require maintenance depending on the time it has been running. We make the necessary repairs, ensuring the equipment is durable for extended periods.

The study and collection of many low-cost earthquake-resistant techniques for structures were done.  Then I made several designs on Autodesk Revit and compared the designs with each other to see which design performed the best in earthquake scenarios. The designs were made on the basis of knowledge gained from the case studies and other useful research papers. Final conclusions were drawn to give and idea for a low-cost earthquake resistant structure for the Himalayas. ",
