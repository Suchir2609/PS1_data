There were many different libraries used like BeautifulSoap. Then we were introduced to OpenAI and GPT-3 and we used GPT-3 for the project of keyword extraction. I learnt and understood the working behind GPT-3. It is a machine learning model which takes a sequence of inputs and generates the output by using what the model has learned during its training phase. It started with an untrained model, it was trained on a huge dataset consisting of million tokens of text. One step of the training of GPT 3 is to generate multiple training examples. When the model generates the output, it'll be not a good output, that's because it's being trained, then we tell the correct answer and then calculate the error and then the gradients are adjusted using back propagation, we tell how much the prediction is wrong and that error calculation is fed back into the model, so that when the next time the model gives us the output, there'll be less error and more accuracy. GPT 3 takes each token at a time and also, outputs one token at a time. The main thing about GPT-3 is its size, it is a huge model, has 175 billion parameters. The parameters are stored into various matrices, generating the prediction is multiplying the matrices together by the inputs. When we process a word, we process the vector and it goes through various layers of transformer decoders and GPT-3 has 96 of these transformer decoders. It is trained on 'next word' prediction the transformer decoder will train the parameters so that it can predict the next word using a bunch of words at the input.

The design of the project was the integration of Streamlit with GPT-3 using a Python script. The model was tested on a number of input texts to see how efficiently it extracts the keywords from the text. As the model has been trained on enormous and diverse corpus of text via datasets, the model has a very good way of detecting the keywords. The model is very productive and can be used for detecting the keywords in search engines. The project of keyword extraction has some future aspects of being used in a search engine where if a person searches for something, for example, \"a red t-shirt\" then the keyword would be red and t-shirt, so that it would help the user in choosing the items and looking at only what they desire to see.

Our PS1 started with deciding that I wanted to work on a Computer Vision project and formed a group for the same. We chose our topic as Image Based Search Engine for Fashion Products. The idea in our mind being say you go shopping and want to compare a shirts price online before buying in the market, you can simply click a picture and search it on say Myntra or you want to find what your friends wearing in an Instagram post so simply take a screenshot and search. For this project we had to build a machine learning model which detects all clothing/footwear objects in an image and hence we needed an object detection model. Next steps were to decide a database and a model. Choosing the right dataset was a hard task and it took us quite a bit of time and experimenting to finally arrive at the right one. Our mentor told us try out two models which go by the name of YOLO and Faster-RCNN. We researched them and trained on the two models and found better results on YOLOv5. So we went ahead and built a webpage around the same with Streamlit, an easy to code Python library. ", "experience": "UST is a big company with working on various state-of-the-art technologies.

We learnt about training and testing data which is called fine tuning the model.

Firstly, we had to revise fundamentals of various python libraries to learn web scraping and automation. Secondly, we explored OpenAI & gpt-3 which would help us easily create a Q&A bot with its inbuilt NLP models.  Next, we modified this Q&A bot into a basic chatbot in a python script. This was a generic chatbot. Now our next task was to finetune a dataset and feed it to the Chatbot. So, we explored many data sets and started working on the easily compatible one. Also, we wanted our Chatbot to be a webpage, so we used streamlit as UI for that purpose. Lastly, we had automated the model to extract data from pdf and convert it into a data set internally. Thus, we successfully made a Chatbot that would be able to give contextualized response from the pdf/source material provided to it. This chatbot model would be really useful for small scale companies. It can help them widen their customer reach and enable them to interact with them with ease.
